# Transliterator
I developed this code to transliterate my English letter input into Japanese symbol output. 
It works by reading a file that has English letters(romaji) on the left of each colon.
The romaji is then processed through the main algorithm getUserRomaji which converts it into Japanese symbols (hiragana).
The hiragana is then written on the file to the right of the corresponding colon.
